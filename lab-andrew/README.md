# Lab 30 Heaps and Basic Sorting

## Overview

This is a model of a max heap and a basic sorting algorithm.
***
## Getting Started

Basic understanding of git and npm is assumed. Clone down the repo and navigate to the directory. Install by running `npm i`. If you wish to use these constructors, simply copy the desired constructor's file into your project and require it into the script in which you would like to use it. For example:

```const MaxHeap = require('./model/max-heap')```

To run tests to check functionality, do an

```npm run test```

A new max heap can be instatiated with `new MaxHeap(`<`...options`>`)`.
